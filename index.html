            <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>I have spent a significant portion of my career in the service industry, managing people, leading teams, and operating my own businesses. This has developed a strong desire to ensure my customer's success.
                I am an analytical and strategic thinker, eager to learn new concepts to achieve a better outcome. I am goal driven and outcome focused, I enjoy the camaraderie of working as part of a team, and the satisfaction of leading a team to success. 
                It's not just about the destination, itâ€™s how you get there and what you learn along the way that counts.</p>
